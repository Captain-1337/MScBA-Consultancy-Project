# MScBA-Consultancy-Project
Deep Learning for the automatic detection of emotional content in text documents.

<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<br/>The proposed consultancy project aims at creating components capable of automatically identifying<br/>
emotional content in text documents, by researching:<br/>
    (i) methods, <br/>
    (ii) existing systems,<br/>
    (iii) corpora for emotion detection. <br/>
    
<h2>Project roadmap:</h2>
<br/>1.  A comprehensive literature review should provide an overview of relevant lexicons, gold standard corpora and methods.<br/><br/>
2.  Based on the literature review the students extend/create an English and/or German evaluation corpus <br/>
    used for training and evaluating  their emotion detection method.<br/><br/>
3.  The following approaches for detecting emotional content are implemented:<br/>
    a lexicon-based method that detects the mentioned emotions in text messages considering the grammatical <br/> structure provided by a third-party tool. <br/><br/>
    a deep-learning-based approach that uses embeddings (see literature) <br/>
    rather than emotion lexicons for identifying emotional content.<br/><br/>
4.  Evaluate the created classifier based on the evaluation corpora from step (2) <br/>
    using standard evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1).<br/>
