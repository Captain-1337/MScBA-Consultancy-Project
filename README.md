# MScBA-Consultancy-Project
Deep Learning for the automatic detection of emotional content in text documents.

## Objectives:

The proposed consultancy project aims at creating components capable of automatically identifying
emotional content in text documents, by researching:
    (i) methods, 
    (ii) existing systems,
    (iii) corpora for emotion detection. 
    
## Project roadmap:

1.  A comprehensive literature review should provide an overview of relevant lexicons, gold standard corpora and methods.
2.  Based on the literature review the students extend/create an English and/or German evaluation corpus 
    used for training and evaluating  their emotion detection method.
3.  The following approaches for detecting emotional content are implemented:
  a lexicon-based method that detects the mentioned emotions in text messages considering the grammatical <br/> structure provided by a third-party tool.
  a deep-learning-based approach that uses embeddings (see literature) 
    rather than emotion lexicons for identifying emotional content.
4.  Evaluate the created classifier based on the evaluation corpora from step (2) 
    using standard evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1).
    
## Project structur
### Codes
    Folder for the coding :) ðŸ¤©
### interrater
    Folder of raw data for our sample of the inter-rater reliability check
### results
    Folder of results includes some file of the lexicon based calculation

## Corpora
For our emotion detection we are using primary the multigenre corpra from https://github.com/shabnamt/jointMultitaskEmo/tree/master/data/emo_multigenre
