7246	A movie in which two not very absorbing characters are engaged in a romance you ca n't wait to see end .	disgust	moviereview
7256	The story has its redundancies , and the young actors , not very experienced , are sometimes inexpressive .	disgust	moviereview
7299	Laconic and very stilted in its dialogue , this indie flick never found its audience , probably because it 's extremely hard to relate to any of the characters .	disgust	moviereview
7308	The fact that it is n't very good is almost beside the point .	disgust	moviereview
7318	It 's mildly amusing , but I certainly ca n't recommend it .	disgust	moviereview
7398	Because of an unnecessary and clumsy last scene , ` Swimfan ' left me with a very bad feeling .	disgust	moviereview
7403	It 's hard to like a film about a guy who is utterly unlikeable , and Shiner , starring Michael Caine as an aging British boxing promoter desperate for a taste of fame and fortune , is certainly that .	disgust	moviereview
7455	This is not the undisputed worst boxing movie ever , but it 's certainly not a champion - the big loser is the audience .	disgust	moviereview
7465	The twist that ends the movie is the one with the most emotional resonance , but twists are getting irritating , and this is the kind of material where the filmmakers should be very careful about raising eyebrows .	disgust	moviereview
7514	At its worst , it implodes in a series of very bad special effects .	disgust	moviereview
7543	A very long movie , dull in stretches , with entirely too much focus on meal preparation and igloo construction .	disgust	moviereview
7584	"The script is n't very good ; not even someone as gifted as Hoffman -LRB- the actor -RRB- can make it work ."	disgust	moviereview
7592	Like all abstract art , the film does not make this statement in an easily accessible way , and -- unless prewarned -- it would be very possible for a reasonably intelligent person to sit through its tidal wave of imagery and not get this vision at all .	noemotion	moviereview
7631	It 's slow -- very , very slow .	disgust	moviereview
7705	I sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie does n't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand .	disgust	moviereview
7783	There is very little dread or apprehension , and though I like the creepy ideas , they are not executed with anything more than perfunctory skill .	disgust	moviereview
7797	At the very least , if you do n't know anything about Derrida when you walk into the theater , you wo n't know much more when you leave .	disgust	moviereview
7824	Offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .	disgust	moviereview
7950	Uncertain in tone ... a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity Short Cuts by way of Very Bad Things .	disgust	moviereview
8087	Birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .	disgust	moviereview
8094	It is a comedy that 's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling -LRB- and an uneasy alliance , at that -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
8180	Like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in The Twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten .	disgust	moviereview
8194	The premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film 's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them .	disgust	moviereview
8229	Thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad Scouse accents	disgust	moviereview
8290	This is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few .	disgust	moviereview
8316	A very bad sign .	disgust	moviereview
8389	Borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .	disgust	moviereview
8399	This idea has lost its originality ... and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .	disgust	moviereview
8401	The film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low .	disgust	moviereview
8491	The backyard battles you staged with your green plastic army men were more exciting and almost certainly made more sense .	disgust	moviereview
8566	The movie has very little to offer besides unintentional laughs .	disgust	moviereview
8580	The movie is too cute to take itself too seriously , but it still feels like it was made by some very stoned college students .	disgust	moviereview
8584	Plays as hollow catharsis , with lots of tears but very little in the way of insights .	disgust	moviereview
8674	A very stylish but ultimately extremely silly tale ... a slick piece of nonsense but nothing more .	disgust	moviereview
8709	This extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .	disgust	moviereview
8718	A very average science fiction film .	noemotion	moviereview
8789	The plot is very clever , but Boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of .	disgust	moviereview
8802	While obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut .	disgust	moviereview
8890	It 's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you 're more than six years old .	disgust	moviereview
8895	Admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch .	disgust	moviereview
8958	Though certainly original in form , Altar Boys requires a taste for Swamp Thing-type animation , doubled with a deafening score .	disgust	moviereview
8978	Reggio falls victim to relying on the very digital technology that he fervently scorns , creating a meandering , inarticulate and ultimately disappointing film .	disgust	moviereview
8979	The movie makes absolutely no sense .	disgust	moviereview
9062	Build some robots , haul 'em to the theatre with you for the late show , and put on your own Mystery Science Theatre 3000 tribute to what is almost certainly going to go down as the worst -- and only -- killer website movie of this or any other year .	disgust	moviereview
9125	Limps along on a squirm-inducing fish-out-of-water formula that goes nowhere and goes there very , very slowly .	disgust	moviereview
9171	Though there are entertaining and audacious moments , the movie 's wildly careening tone and an extremely flat lead performance do little to salvage this filmmaker 's flailing reputation .	disgust	moviereview
9179	-LRB- I -RRB- t 's certainly laudable that the movie deals with hot-button issues in a comedic context , but Barbershop is n't as funny as it should be .	sadness	moviereview
9213	The movie certainly has its share of clever moments and biting dialogue , but there 's just not much lurking below its abstract surface .	disgust	moviereview
9218	Obviously , a lot of people wasted a lot of their time -LRB- including mine -RRB- on something very inconsequential .	disgust	moviereview
9231	Benigni 's Pinocchio is extremely straight and mind-numbingly stilted , its episodic pacing keeping the film from developing any storytelling flow .	disgust	moviereview
9252	-LRB- Seagal 's -RRB- strenuous attempt at a change in expression could very well clinch him this year 's Razzie .	disgust	moviereview
9288	"Roman Polanski directs The Pianist like a surgeon mends a broken heart ; very meticulously but without any passion ."	disgust	moviereview
9290	Lan Yu is certainly a serviceable melodrama , but it does n't even try for the greatness that Happy Together shoots for -LRB- and misses -RRB- .	disgust	moviereview
9298	Twenty years later , Reggio still knows how to make a point with poetic imagery , but his ability to startle has been stifled by the very prevalence of the fast-forward technology that he so stringently takes to task .	joy	moviereview
9313	There are moments of real pleasure to be found in Sara Sugarman 's whimsical comedy Very Annie-Mary but not enough to sustain the film .	joy	moviereview
9354	Everything in Maid in Manhattan is exceedingly pleasant , designed not to offend .	joy	moviereview
9367	The good is very , very good ... The rest runs from mildly unimpressive to despairingly awful .	disgust	moviereview
9484	Because the intelligence level of the characters must be low , very low , very very low , for the masquerade to work , the movie contains no wit , only labored gags .	disgust	moviereview
9496	But it is set in a world that is very , very far from the one most of us inhabit .	noemotion	moviereview
9510	Frida is certainly no disaster , but neither is it the Kahlo movie Frida fans have been looking for .	disgust	moviereview
9517	If you enjoy being rewarded by a script that assumes you are n't very bright , then Blood Work is for you .	disgust	moviereview
9521	A family-friendly fantasy that ends up doing very little with its imaginative premise .	disgust	moviereview
9525	A fast-paced , glitzy but extremely silly piece .	noemotion	moviereview
9623	... the picture 's cleverness is ironically muted by the very people who are intended to make it shine .	disgust	moviereview
9661	It 's not the worst comedy of the year , but it certainly wo n't win any honors .	disgust	moviereview
9711	At three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .	disgust	moviereview
9719	There 's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man 's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .	disgust	moviereview
9738	There are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills .	disgust	moviereview
9761	Presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .	disgust	moviereview
9826	This is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .	disgust	moviereview
9912	A movie that harps on media-constructed ` issues ' like whether compromise is the death of self ... this Orgasm -LRB- wo n't be an -RRB- exceedingly memorable one for most people .	disgust	moviereview
9927	The Chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .	disgust	moviereview
9934	It 's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .	disgust	moviereview
9955	The biggest problem I have -LRB- other than the very sluggish pace -RRB- is we never really see her Esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .	disgust	moviereview
9986	A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact .	joy	moviereview
10001	Translation : ` We do n't need to try very hard . '	disgust	moviereview
10047	It is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .	disgust	moviereview
10181	Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .	joy	moviereview
10187	Whereas the extremely competent hitman films such as Pulp Fiction and Get Shorty resonate a sardonic verve to their caustic purpose for existing , Who Is Cletis Tout ?	noemotion	moviereview
10194	Directed by Kevin Bray , whose crisp framing , edgy camera work , and wholesale ineptitude with acting , tone and pace very obviously mark him as a video helmer making his feature debut .	disgust	moviereview
10230	It 's horribly depressing and not very well done .	disgust	moviereview
10238	It 's just merely very bad .	disgust	moviereview
10243	In my own very humble opinion , In Praise of Love lacks even the most fragmented charms I have found in almost all of his previous works .	disgust	moviereview
10314	This is a heartfelt story ... it just is n't a very involving one .	disgust	moviereview
10357	Any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .	joy	moviereview
10456	A very slow , uneventful ride around a pretty tattered old carousel .	joy	moviereview
10468	Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .	disgust	moviereview
10534	Sweet Home Alabama certainly wo n't be remembered as one of -LRB- Witherspoon 's -RRB- better films .	sadness	moviereview
10550	Paul Bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .	disgust	moviereview
10638	Even as I valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , I could feel my eyelids ... getting ... very ... heavy ...	disgust	moviereview
10648	The pace of the film is very slow -LRB- for obvious reasons -RRB- and that too becomes off-putting .	disgust	moviereview
10739	Represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller/horror genre .	joy	moviereview
10798	From its nauseating spinning credits sequence to a very talented but underutilized supporting cast , Bartleby squanders as much as it gives out .	disgust	moviereview
10823	What we have here is n't a disaster , exactly , but a very handsomely produced let-down .	sadness	moviereview
10834	The film rehashes several old themes and is capped with pointless extremes -- it 's insanely violent and very graphic .	disgust	moviereview
10846	It 's absolutely amazing how first-time director Kevin Donovan managed to find something new to add to the canon of Chan .	joy	moviereview
10853	I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .	disgust	moviereview
10856	A pint-sized ` Goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest .	joy	moviereview
10878	While there 's likely very little crossover appeal to those without much interest in the Elizabethans -LRB- as well as rank frustration from those in the know about Rubbo 's dumbed-down tactics -RRB- , Much Ado About Something is an amicable endeavor .	joy	moviereview
10997	Don Michael Paul uses quick-cuts , -LRB- very -RRB- large shadows and wide-angle shots taken from a distance to hide the liberal use of a body double -LRB- for Seagal -RRB- .	joy	moviereview
11035	The problem with `` XXX '' is that its own action is n't very effective .	disgust	moviereview
11064	Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio .	noemotion	moviereview
11090	Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .	disgust	moviereview
11155	And a very rainy day .	noemotion	moviereview
11222	This is very much of a mixed bag , with enough negatives to outweigh the positives .	disgust	moviereview
11227	"Not once in the rush to save the day did I become very involved in the proceedings ; to me , it was just a matter of ` eh . '"	disgust	moviereview
11332	... for all its social and political potential , State Property does n't end up being very inspiring or insightful .	disgust	moviereview
11394	It feels like very light Errol Morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs .	disgust	moviereview
11414	The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary .	disgust	moviereview
11416	A very familiar tale , one that 's been told by countless filmmakers about Italian - , Chinese - , Irish - , Latin - , Indian - , Russian - and other hyphenate American young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages .	noemotion	moviereview
11452	Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors .	disgust	moviereview
11502	The high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : There 's very little hustling on view .	disgust	moviereview
11520	You come away thinking not only that Kate is n't very bright , but that she has n't been worth caring about and that maybe she , Janine and Molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .	disgust	moviereview
11564	A bittersweet contemporary comedy about benevolent deception , which , while it may not rival the filmmaker 's period pieces , is still very much worth seeing .	joy	moviereview
