5948	Unfortunately , it 's also not very good .	disgust	moviereview
5950	It wraps up a classic mother/daughter struggle in recycled paper with a shiny new bow and while the audience can tell it 's not all new , at least it looks pretty .	joy	moviereview

10600	While Serving Sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest Austin Powers extravaganza , there 's nothing here to match that movie 's intermittent moments of inspiration .	disgust	moviereview
10601	I 'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by Vincent R. Nebrida or the gutless direction by Laurice Guillen .	disgust	moviereview
10604	As with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else .	disgust	moviereview

10655	Despite some comic sparks , Welcome to Collinwood never catches fire .	disgust	moviereview
10656	Director George Hickenlooper has had some success with documentaries , but here his sense of story and his juvenile camera movements smack of a film school undergrad , and his maudlin ending might not have gotten him into film school in the first place .	disgust	moviereview
10660	All the small moments and flashbacks do n't add up to much more than trite observations on the human condition .	disgust	moviereview

10716	For all of its insights into the dream world of teen life , and its electronic expression through cyber culture , the film gives no quarter to anyone seeking to pull a cohesive story out of its 2 1/2 - hour running time .	disgust	moviereview
10717	Enough is not a bad movie , just mediocre .	sadness	moviereview
10720	The film never finds its tone and several scenes run too long .	disgust	moviereview

10843	The most excruciating 86 minutes one might sit through this summer that do not involve a dentist drill .	disgust	moviereview

10853	I found it slow , predictable and not very amusing .	disgust	moviereview
10854	Director Yu seems far more interested in gross-out humor than in showing us well-thought stunts or a car chase that we have n't seen 10,000 times .	disgust	moviereview
10856	A pint-sized ` Goodfellas ' designed to appeal to the younger set , it 's not a very good movie in any objective sense , but it does mostly hold one 's interest .	joy	moviereview
10859	It 's definitely not made for kids or their parents , for that matter , and I think even fans of Sandler 's comic taste may find it uninteresting .	disgust	moviereview
10864	It 's as if Solondz had two ideas for two movies , could n't really figure out how to flesh either out , so he just slopped ` em together here .	disgust	moviereview
10872	-LRB- T -RRB- he script is n't up to the level of the direction , nor are the uneven performances by the cast members , who seem bound and determined to duplicate Bela Lugosi 's now-cliched vampire accent .	disgust	moviereview
10881	Perry 's good and his is an interesting character , but `` Serving Sara '' has n't much more to serve than silly fluff .	disgust	moviereview
10888	The movie 's biggest shocks come from seeing former nymphette Juliette Lewis playing a salt-of-the-earth mommy named Minnie and watching Slim travel incognito in a ridiculous wig no respectable Halloween costume shop would ever try to sell .	disgust	moviereview
10890	It appears as if even the filmmakers did n't know what kind of movie they were making .	disgust	moviereview

10906	Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws .	disgust	moviereview
10907	Unlike Trey Parker , Sandler does n't understand that the idea of exploiting molestation for laughs is funny , not actually exploiting it yourself .	disgust	moviereview
10919	Feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .	disgust	moviereview
10928	Davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .	disgust	moviereview
10930	Ultimately , the film never recovers from the clumsy clich of the ugly American abroad , and the too-frosty exterior Ms. Paltrow employs to authenticate her British persona is another liability .	disgust	moviereview
10932	Tom Green and an Ivy League college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like Stealing Harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .	disgust	moviereview

10987	Once the expectation of laughter has been quashed by whatever obscenity is at hand , even the funniest idea is n't funny .	disgust	moviereview
10989	The connected stories of Breitbart and Hanussen are actually fascinating , but the filmmaking in Invincible is such that the movie does not do them justice .	disgust	moviereview
10991	Return to Never Land is much more P.C. than the original version -LRB- no more racist portraits of Indians , for instance -RRB- , but the excitement is missing .	sadness	moviereview

11076	little action , almost no suspense or believable tension , one-dimensional characters up the wazoo and sets that can only be described as sci-fi generic .	disgust	moviereview
11080	Do n't say you were n't warned .	disgust	moviereview
11087	The movie is concocted and carried out by folks worthy of scorn , and the nicest thing I can say is that I ca n't remember a single name responsible for it .	disgust	moviereview
11089	You ca n't believe anyone would really buy this stuff .	disgust	moviereview
11090	Certainly beautiful to look at , but its not very informative about its titular character and no more challenging than your average television biopic .	disgust	moviereview
11100	Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .	disgust	moviereview
11103	Alas , getting there is not even half the interest .	disgust	moviereview
11106	Deuces Wild treads heavily into Romeo and Juliet/West Side Story territory , where it plainly has no business going .	disgust	moviereview
11107	Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .	disgust	moviereview
11113	It dabbles all around , never gaining much momentum .	disgust	moviereview
11116	Forages for audience sympathy like a temperamental child begging for attention , giving audiences no reason to truly care for its decrepit freaks beyond the promise of a reprieve from their incessant whining .	disgust	moviereview

11142	This hastily mounted production exists only to capitalize on Hopkins ' inclination to play Hannibal Lecter again , even though Harris has no immediate inclination to provide a fourth book .	disgust	moviereview

11252	Ultimately , Sarah 's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman 's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness .	disgust	moviereview

11323	Talkiness is n't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark .	disgust	moviereview
11324	The beautiful images and solemn words can not disguise the slack complacency of -LRB- Godard 's -RRB- vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice .	disgust	moviereview

13741	Of course once he says the magic words degenerative arthritis and not uncommon AT MY AGE I do a total brain freeze and hear pretty much nothing afterwards.	fear	blog
13745	I'm not going to grow old gracefully.	fear	blog
13752	I will not play the part that others have chosen for me.	anger	blog
13753	Sucks for Levon but he said he wouldn't let me drive with the trailer anyways.	anger	blog
13755	I know I can drive that's not my problem I just need to study more for the written.	noemotion	blog
13759	couldn't the fucking terrorists decide to get caught, you know, after i landed.	anger	blog
13763	so far, all you've done is to cause international travellers the annoyance of having to hand over their toothpaste and make sure their baby's formula isn't nitroglycerin by drinking some.	anger	blog
13771	when you annoy us long enough NO ONE WILL CARE ABOUT RESTRAINT.	anger	blog
13778	trying to keep my rational and logical mind from straying to bad thoughts about how stupid the human race is and how religion is nothing but trouble.	disgust	blog
13781	I look up the address he mumbles to me and see that no payment has come in for 5 months.	noemotion	blog
13784	Or some woman will call with a question that has nothing to do with circulation.	disgust	blog
13790	He got up and said he doesn't have to take this from us and was especially angry at me. I was a mega bitch to him.	anger	blog
13794	He didn't want to make eye contact with me, but we made eye contact a lot.	noemotion	blog
13801	I told him he didn't lose me, and he just looked at me and didn't say a word.	joy	blog
13804	I know I shouldn't have been snotty about it but I thought it was fucking obvious.	anger	blog
13808	I never even told him what happened, but he helped, a lot.	joy	blog
13827	P.S. If you don't understand exactly what I did it's a bit technical, just know that it was impressive and I rock.	joy	blog
13828	P.P.S. When I say that you might not understand because it's technical, I'm not trying to brag, it's just kind of specialized in the same way I don't understand when people talk about car repair or finance.	noemotion	blog
13830	We decided we'd watch as much episodes as possible and also made a promise none of us would use the computer.	anticipation	blog
13834	I haven't really been going out much and it just makes me mad since I told myself this summer I'd make the best of it since I'd be going to university in September.	anger	blog
13837	Congratulations- and Welcome to Corporate America- where the Vice Presidents and Senior Officers and Managers don't hibernate-- they walk among you.	joy	blog
13850	She never once had a caller that she didn't make laugh- at least once during their call.	joy	blog
13853	but I've not talked to the most important person in my life- in over a week.	sadness	blog
13859	The thread to this relationship is wearing thin- it's on it's last strand- and though he may think it's cool to not do what he says hes going to- it's not cool to me.	disgust	blog
13876	If not I may have to get her a shot to induce labor.	anticipation	blog
13877	That was one of the first things that Wayne wanted to know hows alley, has she had the pups I think he loves those dogs as much as me! I'll never forget the first tail that he docked by himself it was Tuff's tail.	joy	blog
13886	I can't decide if I want to pay the fee to make it a fancy blog.	noemotion	blog
13892	When I come back from my Survival course and return to work, I won't have a staff anymore.	sadness	blog
13894	I'll miss them and can't say goodbye properly now.	sadness	blog
13917	I never really noticed it but Natalie, Ryan, Christan Leslie are fun to be around with.	joy	blog
13927	Sucks I didn't bring my camera but yeeah.	sadness	blog
13928	I think tomorrow a friend`s coming over ? Not sure who, haha kaay bye.	surprise	blog
13931	So far I have done zip camping, no trips to the lake.	noemotion	blog
13932	I have been quite preoccupied though so I can't blame my lack of summer fun on laziness.	noemotion	blog
13934	just once I would love to not have to worry about that sort of thing.	fear	blog
13936	but this is life and we must not forget that like is not a holiday.	sadness	blog
13940	I haven't really given school much thought as of recent times.	noemotion	blog
13941	I started with one dream, and was working towards it, now I don't see it anymore.	sadness	blog
13946	it  gets me out of the job I'm in and will open the doors to other opportunities that aren't available to me now.	anticipation	blog
13947	Maybe I have become lazy in thought b/c I don't bother with it.	disgust	blog
13948	Worry gains you no more minutes to  your life.	noemotion	blog
13950	we have no one to blame but our selves.	sadness	blog
13954	I don't have a plan, I don't know what I want in the long run.	fear	blog
13960	I have a job where I have come to know some amazing people who have such potential, but possibly will never get to put it to any use due to the cirumstances of the choices in life.	sadness	blog
13963	I am happy with a casual, not serious, no pressure relationship.	joy	blog
13967	laughing out loud, lets just hope I don't run out of time to complete it.	joy	blog
13979	All in all, I'm satisfied with the bigger picture and angry as fuck at the smaller details, but that's what keeps you going, isn't it.	anger	blog
13980	As far as support mechanisms go, I've seen what they do to people- at their best, they act as a bridge to help people reach things both within and outside themself that they may not have been previously able to reach.	joy	blog
13982	I think sometimes it can be easy to lose track of the idea that happiness and comfort are two completely separate entities and having one does not guarantee or equal having the other some of the time, at least.	noemotion	blog
13986	It can be really difficult to appreciate just what a friendship really means to you, especially when it's something you can take for granted fairly easily if you aren't careful.	noemotion	blog
13989	Old wounds fester into something that can't be healed, neglect becomes forgetfulness which then becomes amnesia, and before long you wonder if it ever happened.	sadness	blog
13994	There's usually no way to know until it's too late regardless.	surprise	blog
13995	I guess I do what I can to make the most of what I have, if it's not enough then it likely never was, and in that case, at least I know I tried.	noemotion	blog
13996	If being a friend isn't about trying, then I've been taking the wrong approach all along.	sadness	blog
13998	I'm not going to go into specifics here, but it almost always ends up in yelling and tears.	anger	blog
14003	I know its normal for someone who's in college to be living with their parents, but that doesn't quell the wish to be independent and free.	noemotion	blog
14004	Now me and Tyler are running the shop and I don't know if Tyler's even going to stay or not.	fear	blog
14005	Lots of angry costomers with half finished work, a boss who pays for the furniture but has no idea how to run a business.	disgust	blog
14008	I have been TRYING to post for three days, but bloody Spaces was having issues errors on pages and I couldn't do it - my Wanker Boss post was due to be posted on Thursday.	noemotion	blog
14011	But I asked him about WHY he doesn't cook for himself, and he said he just doesn't have enough time.	noemotion	blog
14013	This is the man who gets into the office at 10:30am, leaves by 3pm, takes 20minutes to get to the office, dry cleans all his clothes, has a cleaner, doesn't have a wife or family to chase after - and he doesn't have time?I explained that I travel 1.5 hours each way, every day to go to work, I go to the gym more than he does, I cook my meals, I have a life, and I have a house to look after.	disgust	blog
14017	no wonder he doesn't have a girlfrend if his definition of more important things than actually looking after yourself like an adult isn't important enough.	disgust	blog
14018	I think though, what pisses me most off about the food delivery issue - is that he has chosen the easy I don't have to do anything option.	anger	blog
14019	If I could afford the food, I would probably do it myself, but Jenny Craig was expensive enough, and that was $100 a week, not $250, and I didn't have a mortgage then.	noemotion	blog
14020	But since he has chosen this option, it's just really irritating me, because he has no concept of a weight problem - he just is lazy.	disgust	blog
14022	Sorry for the ranting post, but I'm just really annoyed that here I am, struggling with all my internal demons about my weight loss, and someone like this, with no concept of struggle, can just pay someone to lose it for him.	anger	blog
14026	I'm not very nice, not when facing death.	fear	blog
14041	I walked over to the heater as the first port of call and was very surprised when 'oh!' it wouldn't turn on.	surprise	blog
14045	We thought for a while about what to do, not really being able to afford either a new fridge OR to fix this one.	sadness	blog
14053	Despite widespread dissatisfaction among Democrats with the Bush administration and overall Republican governance, we detect no real signs so far at least in Harris County of a groundswell to actually vote in November.	noemotion	blog
14055	The argument goes that anger nationally over rising gas prices and health care costs, a protracted, expensive war with no conclusion in sight, and a perception among religious conservatives that George W. Bush has failed to deliver on the social issues that motivate them has taken a toll with GOP base voters.	noemotion	blog
14058	Obviously no way to tell at this point, but any Democratic victory strategy that assumes weak Republican turnout as a key to winning is folly.	disgust	blog
14069	and ive learned from my past relationship what to do and what not to do and watching what i say and how i say it and.	noemotion	blog
14071	so no i wont have my head too high up my ass about it, but im noot going to sit here and think/dread it everyday either.	noemotion	blog
14083	Haven't seen him in ages.	surprise	blog
14088	Whahahaha I nearly cracked myself and don't think I didn't blush.	joy	blog
14092	That be the only reason, cos everyone is scared of driving with me.  >.> Don't ask.	fear	blog
14096	Somehow Anri got the idea in her head that I had to go test the water so that she can take photo's and like that was not enough I had to throw Baywatch moves.	noemotion	blog
14103	Lizelle wanted to go to the movies and I wanted to go to church and Anri I don't know what.	other	blog
14105	Non-christians, don't worry about this part I am just expressing my thoughts, doesn't mean I don't accept you still as a person, just kinda thinking out loud to people that believe the same as me. Hmmm.	noemotion	blog
14108	Didn't think she would do it, but hey.	surprise	blog
14112	No, I'm not a stupid chick for those of you that may be wondering.	anger	blog
14131	, but we won't be able to welcome you into the Armed Forcesor I could do some traveling and explore the country.	noemotion	blog
14138	She tells me that if I was with a person that was infected with gonorrhea, what makes me think that person didn't have anything else.	disgust	blog
14144	The second reason I was pissed was because not only was my friend is dying from this disease and has had it the entire time that we have been friends, but to my knowledge has not taken the appropriate care of himself that a person with HIV should be taking.	anger	blog
14145	He never went to see an infectious disease specialist.	noemotion	blog
14146	He never took any medications other than a multi-vitamin.	noemotion	blog
14149	I had never known to do much of anything unhealthy and  he was one of those health conscious, work out fanatics.	trust	blog
14152	Could it be that he realized that no matter what he did, there was nothing that would get rid of his disease, so he lived and played hard and masked his pain with lots of partying, drugs, and lots of random, annonymous sex.	sadness	blog
14153	I've asked him about this, and he has never really given me an answer.	noemotion	blog
14169	i just do not want to live at home anymore.	sadness	blog
14178	You can't trust Jake's directions to his own bathroom in his own dorm room.	disgust	blog
14192	That, and they may not be exactly great for you.	disgust	blog
14193	I'm not advocating all-structure, all-the-time or anything.	noemotion	blog
14196	but alas, they aren't yet.	noemotion	blog
14202	* When I'm NOT working, I have been known to take myself to brunch on the weekends: just me and whatever novel I'm currently enjoying.	joy	blog
14209	Anyway, I don't want to sully this post with MY list of rituals and ruts.	noemotion	blog
14211	It can be ego-crushing when no one comes to buy anything.	sadness	blog
14214	Don't sweat it, that's just my perception: I traveled the hour and a half trip down on Saturday with American Hero Chris Mautner he attained that storied status by agreeing to drive, arrived a half-hour after the doors opened, stayed until 5:30, then went right back home.	noemotion	blog
14215	That means I didn't see the Ignatz Awards, didn't partake of any post-show gatherings, and missed a big chunk of panels.	disgust	blog
14218	I'd never been to a comics show in my life, so I'd not known any SPX other than what was presented to me there: a pretty swank hotel, a table to pay at in the hall outside, and big ballroom with everyone selling everything inside, and a bunch of other rooms to have educational and informative events in, though all of those were down the hall, around the bend, and down an escalator.	disgust	blog
14223	To say there was no color at all would be misleading, since it was a nice day and there were a number of trees and things, but I did not detect any local pulse at all.	surprise	blog
14227	I love walking around for things to buy, and traveling less than two hours to arrive at the comics spread of my dreams won't raise too many personal hackles, let me tell you.	joy	blog
14228	I also made it a point to say hello to everyone there with whom I'd ever communicated on the internet, though I couldn't find anyone matching Johanna Draper Carlson's description and I totally missed Douglas Wolk.	noemotion	blog
14229	"I'm also really glad I had Chris with me, since he knew a lot of faces that I didn't; he made a fine guide, though one of us would occasionally wander away from the other in the vein of the old NES version of Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, though I'm unsure as to which one of us was Bob Hoskins."	joy	blog
14230	"Actually, I think maybe the best thing about SPX is how everyone is kind of pressed together, comics placed near one another seemingly without much concern for subject matter coherency I heard it was a bit different in prior years, with multiple selling rooms and all; if the creators in attendance and the books on display weren't a comprehensive picture of English-language non-superhero comics, there was at least enough diversity to manage the illusion of comprehensiveness."	joy	blog
14232	To look only at this crowd, you'd imagine that there was no question as to the diversity of the comics-reading audience.	noemotion	blog
14240	I tried to follow Tom's rule of not buying anything on my first trip around the room, but that didn't quite hold.	noemotion	blog
14246	Comics Comics #1-2 edited by Timothy Hodler Dan Nadel I mentioned this yesterday, but didn't note that I also got a hard copy of issue #1.	noemotion	blog
14247	Ed the Happy Clown #2 of 9 by Chester Brown the one I was missing - who says you can't score back-issues at these things?.	noemotion	blog
14248	"Fuzz Pluck in Splitsville #4 of 5 by Ted Stearn surely I can't be the only fan of the mighty Fuzz Pluck; still, I've never seen this in a store, though Fantagraphics had it at their table."	joy	blog
14252	"Paping #11 by various older issue of a deluxe anthology by some interesting-looking creators; the real showpiece was issue #14, with its solid wood covers and impressive prints 'n comics mishmash interior, the whole thing bound by red shoelaces; I just didn't have the roughly $30 needed to spend on it by that point in the show, though."	sadness	blog
14254	"Pulphope.A by Paul Pope a show exclusive, I think; not the full Pope art book coming soon from AdHouse, but a 200 copy ashcan with some exclusive stuff."	noemotion	blog
14261	Because I can't just have a bedroom with bookshelves and dressers, or everyone would know something was wrong with me. And there is something wrong with me, but I just can't figure it out.	sadness	blog
14265	I guess it's hard to read about a condition when you don't know the name of it.	noemotion	blog
14266	I didn't always have this problem.	noemotion	blog
14267	Actually, I don't remember much about my childhood.	sadness	blog
14268	All this not sleeping has a terrible way of playing with your memory.	fear	blog
14269	I don't only feel like the days stretch on interminably.	noemotion	blog
14274	It's not like a sleep in on the weekend.	noemotion	blog
14275	I'd tell my doctor, but I don't go to a doctor.	noemotion	blog
14276	I weigh about 180 lbs, I'm about 5', 10, I don't have anything that seems to be wrong with me. I have these weird scars on my neck.	noemotion	blog
14278	I would say it was from some drunken night of excess, but I've never blacked out either.	noemotion	blog
14279	Oh, I get drunk, but nothing seems to happen to me where I forget.	noemotion	blog
14281	It's unfair that I can remember things like that so well, yet I can't even tell you much about what happened in the rest of my life.	sadness	blog
14287	I, on the other hand, have nothing to go home to.	sadness	blog
14288	I suppose the cold should annoy me. But it doesn't. I begin to take off my shoes.	noemotion	blog
14290	No one is in the lake, and I think everyone thinks something is wrong with me. Something is wrong me, but I still don't know what.	sadness	blog
14291	A person walks by me and says something, but I don't know what, and I'm singing something, but I can't place to tune.	noemotion	blog
14293	I don't listen to music, but I know this song.	noemotion	blog
14301	Mind you, I've been treated like the asshole of the house for the past couple of weeks, and I didn't even do anything at all to deserve it.	anger	blog
14302	But it's all good when folks need or want something, isn't it.	joy	blog
14307	It's pretty awful- there's not much else to say about it.	disgust	blog
14311	I really can't imagine what her family and friends are going through right now because it's a really unnecessary situation- she did not have to die and that's probably the saddest part.	sadness	blog
14320	i didn't see her on Wednesday so i was surprised to find her at the shelter this morning.	surprise	blog
14321	once we got a the top of the trail and started to head down some spastic switch got turned on because she started acting a jumpy, darting all over the place, picking up stones, randomly chewing on tree roots, etc. she probably wanted to play but there's not much room for that on the trail especially on the way down a steep trail.	noemotion	blog
14325	he has a bad left eye which i don't think he has any vision.	noemotion	blog
14326	"during the run we were calling him Lance since he was nameless because when he was laying on his back in the grass he would kick his legs like he was riding a bike; i wrote this stuff down on his sheet but i guess the officer's didn't like the name."	noemotion	blog
14328	I didn't even think about what I was wearing or anything and just left.	noemotion	blog
14329	His dad didn't mind us taking pictures but I think this boy did.	noemotion	blog
14352	No, not the new first season, the William Hartnell black and white forty years ago suck it I'm the first Doctor first season.	noemotion	blog
14355	I spent the majority of the day up in Madison hi Robby, I would have waved but I'm not sure where your house is.	noemotion	blog
14361	It's not so much a matter of the early bird getting the worm as it is the procrastinating bird getting splattered by the semi out on I-90.	disgust	blog
14363	I can't believe it.	surprise	blog
14368	In October the Museums close quite early 1:20pm, so by the time we got in we didn't have a whole lot of time to see things.	sadness	blog
14369	I would have loved to see the Library, but we didn't get to it.	sadness	blog
14373	Didn't have to wait too long, though.	noemotion	blog
14374	I can't believe they do that.	surprise	blog
14377	I've been trying not to think about my life back home, but sometimes it sneaks in, uninvited.	sadness	blog
14380	i was very attentive, and it didn't seem like she was gonna break, so i just stayed there and eventually it stopped and i passed out again.	sadness	blog
14385	all my plans were shot to shit cause the cell waves were all packed and i couldn't get in touch with my friends very well.	anger	blog
14386	and there was a storm at the same time so that didn't help.	fear	blog
14388	then i needed a drink and naturally don't have beer, and i expected all the beer at the supermarket to be warm.	anticipation	blog
14411	Later, there's a phone booth that rings for visitors to pick up, but our timing is never quite right.	surprise	blog
14417	She is looking better than she did, but hasn't eaten anything, so I hope she continues to heal.	anticipation	blog
14420	I think he knows not to cross the line he crossed once before.	noemotion	blog
14421	There wasn't really nothing on campus I could do that I felt like doing.	other	blog
14433	I think the cashier made a mistake, but I didn't say anything.	surprise	blog
14435	It's a SanDisk Micro 1.0 GB jump drive, so not a bad deal.	joy	blog
14437	my guy hasn't seen me for about 4 months, so I wanted to look nice.	anticipation	blog
14438	I've not been acting like myself and I know it.	fear	blog
14442	As I have said before I am happily not taking a class this semester, but these two particular functions were ones that were not to be missed.	joy	blog
14470	There was no formal system of notation, making composing very difficult and time-consuming.	noemotion	blog
14472	Renaissance 1450 - 1600: Humans discovered that Earth is not the center of the universe, so classical music changed along with the rest of the arts.	noemotion	blog
14479	Anyway, classical music wasn't even called classical music back in this time.	noemotion	blog
14480	You can find nearly all of the most popular composers in this era, namely Mozart and Beethoven both of whom didn't know they were writing classical.	noemotion	blog
14497	The autoplay in each entry will be set to off, but please don't be shy, click play.	noemotion	blog
14500	8 of the pro arguments consist of someone listing what I take to be every single county in Oregon from which there are no appellate judges.	noemotion	blog
14503	All in all, most of the arguments are not very convincing one way or the other.	disgust	blog
14509	There seemed to be at least a smidgen of personal experience reflected in that argument, something not really present anywhere else.	noemotion	blog
14510	So I'm leaning slightly in favor, although I mostly don't see how it will make that big of a difference.	noemotion	blog
14511	again, kerstin has proven to herself how she isn't who she wants to be yet.	noemotion	blog
14515	i don't like making decisions b/c i don't want to make the wrong one.	fear	blog
14516	there are no wrong decisions, only different outcomes! but i can't.	noemotion	blog
14518	i talked to her today, she's ok. still a mess since i left from what my dad's told me but nothing new there.	sadness	blog
14531	and im not talking about the stalker hugs Confused! those do not count, crying.	sadness	blog
14532	haven't had any major fights w/ roomies, not even small ones.	noemotion	blog
14545	besides the usual mary had a little lamb and junk i can play swing low sweet chariot, silent night, chopin's funeral march, and i taught myself hurt by nine inch nails/johnny cash by ear because i couldn't find any proper sheet music for it.	noemotion	blog
14556	Markets do not measure everything accurately, and I find this assumption to be disgusting.	disgust	blog
14557	Biodiversity isn't measured because it is more complex than one transaction.	noemotion	blog
14558	And the Walmartisation of the world changes markets for the worse for labour, making people a mere slot in a computerised schedule, with no regard for their free time.	disgust	blog
14561	It makes everything homogeneous in texture, sure, but you never are able to enjoy it in its own context.	joy	blog
14562	Let's not promote gambling the security and livelihoods of people just because they're a few thousand miles away or brown.	disgust	blog
14568	Plus, in such a secretive government, wouldn't this promote corruption.	noemotion	blog
14570	And there's really no reason to encourage those who can afford to gamble on this sort of thing to do something so dispicable and amoral.	disgust	blog
14572	There is so much room for the worst of humanity in doing things like this, let's not encourage it, please.	disgust	blog
14578	Does no one see the problem with that logic.	disgust	blog
14582	As long as terrorists exist, we can't get out of Iraq.	noemotion	blog
14583	As long as there are any terrorists anywhere doing anything, we can't pull out.	disgust	blog
14584	The state of Iraq, what the Iraqi people want, all of that jazz, it's never spoken of at times like these.	sadness	blog
14586	I'd also like to point out that the liberal complaint is not that we're fighting terrorists, it's that we're NOT fighting terrorists.	noemotion	blog
14588	I'm worried that too many people, both in politics and out, don't appreciate the seriousness of the threat to American security and the evil of the enemy that faces us, Mr. Lieberman said at the Waterbury event.	fear	blog
14596	I am, by no means, an art critic.	noemotion	blog
14602	I had never before seen a work by any of the Masters - the closest I have ever gotten to a Michelangelo is watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.	noemotion	blog
14603	It's easy to Google Image search Monet and look at the results, but pictures and posters hold no candle to the real deal.	noemotion	blog
14606	Like I said, I'm no judge of art.	noemotion	blog
14612	I can't find any good images of the weird displays, so to view some you have to look here at the International Body Worlds Online Store.	noemotion	blog
14613	Again, I am no judge of art, and the fact that this exhibit has drawn record numbers of people hint at the possibility that I am off-base.	noemotion	blog
