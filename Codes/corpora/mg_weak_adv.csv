5593	Paid in Full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of Goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .	disgust	moviereview

5852	Confusion is one of my least favourite emotions , especially when I have to put up with 146 minutes of it .	disgust	moviereview
5903	Such an incomprehensible mess that it feels less like bad cinema than like being stuck in a dark pit having a nightmare about bad cinema .	disgust	moviereview

5960	To build a feel-good fantasy around a vain dictator-madman is off-putting , to say the least , not to mention inappropriate and wildly undeserved .	disgust	moviereview

6481	The movie would seem less of a trifle if Ms. Sugarman followed through on her defiance of the saccharine .	disgust	moviereview
6528	Leaves us wondering less about its ideas and more about its characterization of Hitler and the contrived nature of its provocative conclusion .	disgust	moviereview
6570	Instead of a witty expose on the banality and hypocrisy of too much kid-vid , we get an ugly , mean-spirited lashing out by an adult who 's apparently been forced by his kids to watch too many Barney videos .	disgust	moviereview

7189	Sometimes entertaining , sometimes indulgent -- but never less than pure wankery .	disgust	moviereview

7334	Nicks , seemingly uncertain what 's going to make people laugh , runs the gamut from stale parody to raunchy sex gags to formula romantic comedy .	disgust	moviereview

7494	In his first stab at the form , Jacquot takes a slightly anarchic approach that works only sporadically .	disgust	moviereview

7650	Intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject .	disgust	moviereview
7652	For each chuckle there are at least 10 complete misses , many coming from the amazingly lifelike Tara Reid , whose acting skills are comparable to a cardboard cutout .	disgust	moviereview
7786	Adults will wish the movie were less simplistic , obvious , clumsily plotted and shallowly characterized .	disgust	moviereview
7792	The overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future Hollywood sellouts .	disgust	moviereview

7959	A movie that , rather than skip along the Seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy Paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .	disgust	moviereview
7960	Shot perhaps ` artistically ' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by Joaquin Baca-Asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .	disgust	moviereview

8355	The reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone .	disgust	moviereview
8359	The furious coherence that -LRB- DeNiro -RRB- brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing .	disgust	moviereview

8877	As is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious .	disgust	moviereview
8879	For a film about two mismatched buddies , Crystal and De Niro share little screen time and even less chemistry .	disgust	moviereview
8889	A sophomoric exploration of ` life problems ' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about .	disgust	moviereview

9041	What begins as a seemingly brainless , bubbly romantic comedy becomes a cliche-drenched melodrama by mid-film and , by film 's end , a feminist action fantasy .	disgust	moviereview
9052	Pryor Lite , with half the demons , half the daring , much less talent , many fewer laughs .	disgust	moviereview
9064	... has about 3/4th the fun of its spry 2001 predecessor -- but it 's a rushed , slapdash , sequel-for-the-sake - of-a-sequel with less than half the plot and ingenuity .	disgust	moviereview

9584	Written , flatly , by David Kendall and directed , barely , by There 's Something About Mary co-writer Ed Decter .	disgust	moviereview
9628	Interview With the Assassin is structured less as a documentary and more as a found relic , and as such the film has a difficult time shaking its Blair Witch Project real-time roots .	disgust	moviereview
9629	Cacoyannis ' vision is far less mature , interpreting the play as a call for pity and sympathy for anachronistic phantasms haunting the imagined glory of their own pasts .	disgust	moviereview
9646	What goes on for the 110 minutes of `` Panic Room '' is a battle of witlessness between a not-so-bright mother and daughter and an even less capable trio of criminals .	disgust	moviereview

9867	A little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .	disgust	moviereview

9990	ZigZag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted .	disgust	moviereview

10123	What might have emerged as hilarious lunacy in the hands of Woody Allen or Mel Brooks -LRB- at least during their '70s heyday -RRB- comes across as lame and sophomoric in this debut indie feature .	disgust	moviereview
10181	Aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters .	joy	moviereview
10213	It aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one .	disgust	moviereview
10217	Cherish is a dud -- a romantic comedy that 's not the least bit romantic and only mildly funny .	disgust	moviereview
10255	This pathetic junk is barely an hour long .	disgust	moviereview
10308	It 's a barely tolerable slog over well-trod ground .	disgust	moviereview

10468	Anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .	disgust	moviereview
10481	A distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .	disgust	moviereview
10484	Rather less than the sum of its underventilated pre-fils confrontations .	disgust	moviereview
10485	McKay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .	disgust	moviereview
10509	Holland lets things peter out midway , but it 's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .	joy	moviereview

10631	Unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications .	disgust	moviereview

10651	In his role of observer of the scene , Lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature .	disgust	moviereview

10703	We could have expected a little more human being , and a little less product .	disgust	moviereview
10802	Once again , the intelligence of gay audiences has been grossly underestimated , and a meaty plot and well-developed characters have been sacrificed for skin and flash that barely fizzle .	disgust	moviereview
10830	A movie that the less charitable might describe as a castrated cross between Highlander and Lolita .	disgust	moviereview
10891	Beneath the uncanny , inevitable and seemingly shrewd facade of movie-biz farce ... lies a plot cobbled together from largely flat and uncreative moments .	disgust	moviereview
10941	It stars schticky Chris Rock and stolid Anthony Hopkins , who seem barely in the same movie .	disgust	moviereview
10973	The film boasts at least a few good ideas and features some decent performances , but the result is disappointing .	disgust	moviereview
10980	Lurid and less than lucid work .	disgust	moviereview
10982	At a brief 42 minutes , we need more X and less blab .	noemotion	moviereview
11030	... most viewers will wish there had been more of the `` Queen '' and less of the `` Damned . ''	disgust	moviereview
11051	Adroit but finally a trifle flat , Mad Love does n't galvanize its outrage the way , say , Jane Campion might have done , but at least it possesses some .	disgust	moviereview
11100	Solondz is without doubt an artist of uncompromising vision , but that vision is beginning to feel , if not morally bankrupt , at least terribly monotonous .	disgust	moviereview
11102	Supposedly based upon real , or at least soberly reported incidents , the film ends with a large human tragedy .	sadness	moviereview
11107	Hart 's War seems to want to be a character study , but apparently ca n't quite decide which character .	disgust	moviereview
11109	This latest installment of the horror film franchise that is apparently as invulnerable as its trademark villain has arrived for an incongruous summer playoff , demonstrating yet again that the era of the intelligent , well-made B movie is long gone .	disgust	moviereview
11195	It sounds like another clever if pointless excursion into the abyss , and that 's more or less how it plays out .	disgust	moviereview
11264	The result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel .	disgust	moviereview
11310	An uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection .	surprise	moviereview
11366	-LRB- Lin Chung 's -RRB- voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating -LRB- at least to this Western ear -RRB- , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters .	anger	moviereview
11369	Unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making .	disgust	moviereview
11408	Less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .	disgust	moviereview
11452	Any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of God are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that Bean abhors .	disgust	moviereview
11470	The Santa Clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but I 've got to give it thumbs down .	disgust	moviereview
11486	is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation .	disgust	moviereview
11495	Any film that does n't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss .	disgust	moviereview
11499	"In this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian ."	disgust	moviereview
11510	It 's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 .	disgust	moviereview

14230	"Actually, I think maybe the best thing about SPX is how everyone is kind of pressed together, comics placed near one another seemingly without much concern for subject matter coherency I heard it was a bit different in prior years, with multiple selling rooms and all; if the creators in attendance and the books on display weren't a comprehensive picture of English-language non-superhero comics, there was at least enough diversity to manage the illusion of comprehensiveness."	joy	blog
14238	Nobody was particularly brusque at SPX, at least from among the artists, but I found Chippendale to be consistently the most emphatic and friendly creator around.	joy	blog
14252	"Paping #11 by various older issue of a deluxe anthology by some interesting-looking creators; the real showpiece was issue #14, with its solid wood covers and impressive prints 'n comics mishmash interior, the whole thing bound by red shoelaces; I just didn't have the roughly $30 needed to spend on it by that point in the show, though."	sadness	blog
14502	There's all kinds of thought about how the measure will make judicial positions more or less political, whether those positions already are political, whether it matters that the Oregon constitution originally had district elections and switched to statewide some time ago, whether elections by district mean that some of the judges will be less qualified than others could have been or whether it means that currently underrepresented areas think every rural area will have a better chance to have someone who understands them in the appellate courts, etc.	noemotion	blog
